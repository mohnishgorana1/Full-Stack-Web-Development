            <p >
            Web development is the work involved in developing a website for the Internet (World Wide Web) or an intranet (a private network).<br>
            [1] Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly refers, may include Web engineering, Web design, Web content development, client liaison, client-side/server-side scripting, Web server and network security configuration, and e-commerce development.
            Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing markup and coding.<br>
            [2] Web development may use content management systems (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.

    <h2> Frontend Roadmap </h2>
        <p>The part of a website that the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the client side of the application</p>
    <ol>
        <li name="Html" id="1">HTML 5 
            <p> HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is used to design the front end portion of web pages using markup language. It acts as a skeleton for a website since it is used to make the structure of a website.
            </p>   
        </li>
        <li name="CSS" id="2">CSS
            <p>Cascading Style Sheets fondly referred to as CSS is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. It is used to style our website.</p>

            <p>
            JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website.
            Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
            Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
            Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to accelerate the work of building sites and applications.

    <h2>Backend Roadmap </h2>
        <p>Backend is the server side of a website. It is the part of the website that users cannot see and interact. It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users. It is used to store and arrange data. </p>

    <ol>
        <li name="Lang" id="=b1"> Processing Language 
            <p>PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language  designed specifically  for web development.
            Java: Java is one of the most popular and widely used programming language. It is highly scalable.
            Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.
            Node.js: Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser. </p>

        <li name="Database" id="b2"> Database 
            <p>Web technologies are advancing fast. While you are wondering what 'web applications' are, developers have started to transition to 'progressive web applications'. Almost every web application on the web requires a database. A shopping application requires a database to interact with the products and the customers.

            A dynamic web application such as a news application or a blog requires instant and frequent updating of web pages. For such an application, altering and creating a new HTML page is a tedious task. This is where a database comes into the picture and eases a developer's life.   
                
            Not only retrieval and updating of data, but a database also helps in authentication which is observed in websites having a login and signup functionality. Such websites display customised web pages based on the logged in user. Databases can be a real boon to a web developer if used correctly.</p>

                <li>MySQL</li>
